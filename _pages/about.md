I am a PhD student at [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/), in the [LIRIS](https://liris.cnrs.fr/en) research lab. I am advised by [Laetita Matignon](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/laetitia.matignon/), [Olivier Simonin](http://perso.citi-lab.fr/osimonin/) and [Christian Wolf](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/christian.wolf/). I study Visual Navigation, Embodied AI, Spatial Reasoning. I am interested in learning how to represent/map new photorealistic environments, ground reasoning with language, act efficiently in unknown scenes with few supervision. I interned at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) (FAIR) with [Devendra Chaplot](https://devendrachaplot.github.io/) in summer 2022.

Prior to this, I spent some time as an intern at [Huawei Noah's Ark Computer Vision Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home) in London, working on Image Enhancement with [Sean Moran](https://sjmoran.github.io/), [Steven McDonagh](https://smcdonagh.github.io/), [Sarah Parisot](https://parisots.github.io/), [Greg Slabaugh](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/), and others. I also interned at Orange Labs in Rennes, studying Visual Question Answering with [Corentin Kervadec](https://corentinkervadec.github.io/), [Grigory Antipov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CoOz8K0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Moez Baccouche](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=olfpe-kAAAAJ&hl=fr) and [Christian Wolf](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/christian.wolf/).

I got my Master's degree from [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/en/), with a major in Computer Science. I spent a semester at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm, studying Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

**Reviewing experience**: TPAMI, ICML 2022 (outstanding reviewer), ICLR 2023, ICCV 2023, NeurIPS 2023

**My CV is available [here](/assets/pdf/CV_Pierre_Marza.pdf)**
