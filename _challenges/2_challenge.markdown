**Date:** December, 2018

I participated in the [Huawei Deep Learning Experience](https://huawei-kth-deeplearning2018.bemyapp.com/) during my exchange semester at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) in Stockholm. 

This was a 24h Deep Learning Challenge organized in different European cities. I was part of a team of 4 people. We were ranked 2nd among a few teams in Stockholm.
The task was to perform semi-supervised image classification.
