I will be presenting 2 papers at the [**Nerf4ADR workshop**](https://neural-fields.xyz/) at **ICCV 2023**: [Multi-Object Navigation with dynamically learned neural implicit representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05129) and [AutoNeRF: Training Implicit Scene Representations with Autonomous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11241) (**oral presentation**).
