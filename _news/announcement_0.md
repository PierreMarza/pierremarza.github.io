I presented some of our work on Learning Spatial Reaoning for Multi-Object Navigation during a Workshop on Learning and Robotics organized by the GDR ISIS, and entitled [Apprentissage et Robotique](http://www.gdr-isis.fr/index.php/reunion/456/). Slides are available [here](/al-folio/assets/pdf/GDR_ISIS_29_06_2021_Pierre_Marza.pdf).
